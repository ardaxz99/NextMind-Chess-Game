NextMind Mind Controlled Chess Game  
This is a standalone mind controlled chess game.  
## Requirements and How to use 
It requires NextMind brain-computer interface device.  
First visit https://www.next-mind.com/documentation/quick-start/ and follow the quick start guide.  
Then, open NM Chess.exe and calibrate your device once more by focusing on the red x mark and voila it is ready to go.  
After the calibration step, red x mark cancels the move and cycle symbol allows the user to switch between pawns and other pieces.  

The project will be developed further in the future.  

## Credits  
The project was inspired by ryantoon24's chess game. His project can be found at https://github.com/ryantoon24/NM-Chess.
